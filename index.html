      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <div class="story-text">
        <p>
          In a faraway corner of Mexico, where the sand glows and the sun never
          takes a break, there once lived a man with fire in his heart... and in
          his hand.
        </p>
        <p>His name: <strong>Pepe Peligroso</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          He was known for his legendary Tabasco mixture—so hot that even the
          shadows sweated. But one day, the unthinkable happened: a single drop
          of his super sauce fell into the feed at Don Gallo's chicken farm.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, nothing has been the same.</p>
        <p>
          The chickens have gone crazy! They storm through the streets, pecking,
          flapping, firing with rage. No one knows why they're racing around
          like this—except Pepe. Because it was him... well, sort of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's up to him to make amends. With courage, style, and a good
          dose of Tabasco, Pepe sets out to stop the chickens—before all of
          Mexico is breaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at the end, someone very special awaits:
          <b>El Pollo Supremo</b>—the giant chicken full of hatred, feathers,
          and spice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Pepe wants to defeat him, he'll need more than accuracy. He'll need
          flavor. And lots of Tabasco.
        </p>
